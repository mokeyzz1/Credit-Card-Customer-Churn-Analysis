# Visualization Outputs

This folder contains all the key visualizations generated from the Credit Card Churn Analysis notebook.

## Generated Plots

When you run the notebook sequentially, the following visualizations will be automatically saved here:

### Exploratory Data Analysis
1. **01_churn_distribution.png** - Target variable distribution (count and percentage)
2. **02_demographic_analysis.png** - Age, gender, education, and income analysis by churn
3. **03_financial_behavior_analysis.png** - Monthly spending, credit utilization, transactions, and credit limits
4. **04_correlation_analysis.png** - Feature correlations with churn probability

### Model Performance
5. **05_confusion_matrices.png** - Confusion matrices for Logistic Regression vs Gradient Boosting
6. **06_roc_curves.png** - ROC curve comparison showing model performance

### Business Optimization
7. **07_profit_vs_threshold.png** - Profit optimization across different decision thresholds
8. **08_optimal_threshold_confusion_matrix.png** - Confusion matrix at profit-maximizing threshold
9. **09_roi_breakdown.png** - ROI components: revenue saved, costs, and net ROI
10. **10_sensitivity_analysis.png** - Sensitivity heatmap for different cost/success scenarios
